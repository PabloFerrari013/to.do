# to.do

## ðŸ¤” About the project
This project is a challenge for the Rocketseat Ignite course, in which I must create an application to train what I have learned so far with ReactJS

This application's main objective is a small to-do application, to train a little more about state manipulation in React. Where the following functions are performed:

- Add a new task
- Remove a task
- Mark and unmark a task as complete
